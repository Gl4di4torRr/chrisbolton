                                I lead the Cloud App Dev team which develops features and supports application teams at
                                Delta Air Lines on Red Hat's OpenShift container platform. I develop cloud
                                best practices, documentation and help Delta maintain a Cloud Native and vendor neutral
                                position.

                                <br><br>

                                I worked on right sizing applications. In the OpenShift 3.X environment, we gave
                                application namespaces T-Shirt sizing for the amount of memory and CPU they would receive
                                for all their Pods. In order to save Delta money, we wanted to right size each application
                                namespace. I worked on new automation called GitOps which used a git workflow to apply objects
                                to an OpenShift cluster. The GitOps workflow allowed for customization and automation for
                                each application and portfolio. The tools we used were git, ansible, ansible tower, gitlab ci
                                and the oc cli.

                                I worked on the onboarding operator. We wanted the OpenShift
                                sandbox environment to be a place where application developers could
                                innovate and learn without the friction of opening a ticket for
                                a personal sandbox. The onboarding operator was created to look
                                for users logging into the sandbox cluster. When a user logs into
                                the sandbox cluster, the onboarding operator creates a personal sandbox with
                                12GB of memory, 2 CPU and 5GB of storage for the developer to use for
                                innovation and any kind of personal use. The onboarding operator was
                                written in Go and interacts with the Kubernetes API.

                                I worked on onboarding a new certificate management process: cert manager.
                                The cert manager was a growing operator in the Kubernetes spaces and we decided
                                to onboard this operator as the solution for Delta on OpenShift. Cert Manager
                                worked with Venafi to add Venafi as an issuer for the cert manager. We created the
                                documentation and CI for customers to use the new process and for the team
                                to deploy the cert manager throughout the environment

                                The container adoption team began and Delta started it's journey towards
                                containerizing application. We decided to use Red Hat's OpenShift Container
                                Platform as Delta's PaaS environment. I worked with three pilot application
                                teams and as we onboarded the three applications, I developed the onboarding
                                process for future application teams. I developed application quickstarts,
                                Jenkins shared libraries and some easy buttons to help developers onboard
                                more quickly and easily.
                                <br><br>
                                The container adoption program turned into the Delta PaaS team
                                where I began to lead the application developer side of the team. The Delta
                                PaaS team was composed of Infrastructure Engineers and App Dev Engineers. We
                                continued to improve documentation and automation while there was an ongoing
                                application modernization effort going on at Delta. I worked with the App Mod
                                team to help them onboard fifty application onto the OpenShift environment.
                                <br><br>
                                Every application that onboarded to the platform needed to be secured at the "edge".
                                We developed a kubernetes operator called cert operator that allowed application teams
                                to place their OpenShift route into a "need" state which triggered the cert operator
                                to retrieve a certificate from Delta's cert store (Venafi) and apply the certificate to
                                a route. We created an automated renewal process and automated keystore's as well.

                                I worked on the development tools team where I began to onboard new tools into Delta's
                                environment. Delta was using clearcase with home grown build, storing and deployment tools:
                                RET, RET DEPOT and RET Deploy. We began conversations with different vendors to onboard the new
                                tools. We decided on Gitlab for our code repository, Nexus for the binary store, Jenkins for
                                the CI system, Sonarqube for static code analysis and Slack for chatops. I worked on the
                                logical, physical and conceptual diagrams for each new tool and presented them to Delta's
                                architecture review board. After the tools were stood up, I worked on training the development
                                community on the new tools, how to use them and the best practices.

                                I worked on an application team in Home Depot's merchandise department.
                                I worked on an application called Supplier Onboarding. This application allowed
                                Home Depot merchant to onboard new vendors and new products. The Home Depot
                                merchant would create a contract with a vendor (Black and Decker, etc.) and the
                                contract would be signed, processed, and stored using the Supplier Onboarding
                                application. The technologies were HTML, AngularJS and CSS for the presentation layer,
                                JAVA for the RESTful service layer and DB2 for the database. I worked on developing
                                a single view for merchants so that the merchant could easily access existing contracts
                                and compare contracts. The feature helped save merchants time and energy comparing existing
                                contracts to new contracts. Also, I worked on writing end to end tests using Protractor so
                                that when we did future development, we would know which test cases were broken before shipping
                                the presentation layer to production. Home Depot adopted a new CI system during this time
                                as well: Concourse CI. I worked to develop an end to end CI system for this application. That is,
                                build, package, test, scan, and deploy the application. The pipeline was triggered on every git commit
                                and it gave the team quick visibility into the health of the application.

                                scenarios were different depending on the database. This project spanned multiple
                                areas of Home Depot: security, architecture, database management, etc. Customers
                                would go through the One Click Deploy Eclipse Plug-in to deploy their application
                                to Home Depot's Grid. I created a new page in the workflow where the customer could
                                choose their database (DB2, Cassandra, etc.) and request a data source for their application.
                                The customer (developer) would then click "Deploy" and the request for a data source would be triggered
                                to a RESTful interface, approvals would be triggered (if needed), etc. The customer could
                                check on the status of the Data Source as it went through the workflow process. For the fully
                                automated workflow data sources, the application would be deployed and the data source would be
                                attached to the application immediately. I used a number of different tools and technologies
                                to enable this workflow.

                                I worked on onboarding new development tools to the Home Depot environment. GitHub Enterprise
                                for Home Depot's code repository and JFrog Artifactory for Home Depot's binaries.
                                I worked along side my management to architect and build the systems.

                                I worked on the Application Platform and Development Tools team. I was primarily responsible for
                                The Home Depot's Eclipse and Eclipse Plug-in development. Home Depot has an internal hosting
                                platform called the Grid. I worked on an Eclipse Plug-in called One Click Deploy which allowed
                                Developers to Deploy their applications to the Grid.
                                One Click Deploy interacted with a number of different systems: subversion, IBM MQ, Opsware, ServiceNow etc.
                                The technologies we used were Java with the Eclipse Plugin Development Platform. The developers
                                were able to right click their project, go to one click deploy, choose the development lifecycle:
                                DEV, QA, PRD and deploy their application. One Click Deploy allowed multiple different types of deployments
                                depending on the application requirements: Store, Bastion, etc.

                                Home Depot has an internal application platform called the Grid. The Grid primarily serves Java applications using
                                Tomcat. Every day there was a report on the status of the applications on the Grid. The report went out as a PDF
                                to the leadership team. I made a RESTful service layer (JAVA, JAX-RS, etc.) which connected to a Cassandra
                                Database (already present) and a Presentation Layer (HTML5, CSS, Javascript, Ajax, etc.) to display the Grid
                                in real time We called the application GridStats and I was able to demo the application to my Vice President
                                at the end of my internship.
