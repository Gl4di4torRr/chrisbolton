                                I lead the Cloud App Dev team which develops features and supports application teams at
                                Delta Air Lines on Red Hat's OpenShift container platform. I am a member of Delta's Cloud
                                Center of Expertise focusing on DevOps in the Cloud.

                                <br><br>

                                I worked on right sizing applications. In the OpenShift 3.X environment, the Delta PaaS team gave
                                application namespaces a T-Shirt size for their memory and cpu. The T-Shirt sizing created a large
                                amount of unused cpu and memory. In order to save Delta money,
                                we wanted to right size each application
                                namespace. I worked on new automation called GitOps which uses a git workflow to apply OpenShift objects
                                to the cluster. The GitOps workflow allowed for customization and automation for
                                each application and portfolio. The tools we used were git, ansible, ansible tower, gitlab ci
                                and the oc cli.

                                <br><br>

                                I worked on the onboarding operator. We wanted the OpenShift
                                sandbox environment to be a place where application developers could
                                innovate and learn without the friction of opening a ticket for
                                a personal sandbox. The onboarding operator looks
                                for users logging into the sandbox cluster. When a user logs into
                                the sandbox cluster, the onboarding operator creates a personal sandbox with
                                12 GB of memory, 2 CPU and 5 GB of storage for the developer to use for
                                innovation and any kind of personal use. The onboarding operator was
                                written in Go and interacts with the OpenShift/Kubernetes API.
                                <br/><br/>
                                I onboarded a new certificate management operator: cert manager.
                                The cert manager is a growing operator in the Kubernetes spaces and we decided
                                to onboard this operator as the solution for Delta on OpenShift. Cert Manager
                                integrates with Venafi which is Delta's certificate store.
                                We created the documentation and CI processes so that our
                                customers would be able to automatically apply a certificate to their OpenShift route.

                                The container adoption program was kicked off and Delta began containerizing applications.
                                Delta decided to use Red Hat's OpenShift Container
                                Platform as Delta's PaaS environment. I worked with three pilot application
                                teams and to onboard them onto the new PaaS environment. I developed the onboarding
                                process for future application teams, along with application quickstarts,
                                Jenkins shared libraries and some easy buttons to help developers onboard
                                more quickly and easily.
                                <br><br>
                                The container adoption program turned into the Delta PaaS team
                                where I began to lead the application developer side of the team. The Delta
                                PaaS team is composed of Infrastructure Engineers and App Dev Engineers. We
                                continued to improve documentation and automation while there was an ongoing
                                application modernization effort going on at Delta. I worked with the App Mod
                                team to help them onboard fifty applications onto the OpenShift environment.
                                <br><br>
                                Every application that onboarded to the platform needed to be secured at the "edge".
                                We developed a kubernetes operator called cert operator that allowed application teams
                                to place their OpenShift route into a "need" state which triggered the cert operator
                                to retrieve a certificate from Delta's cert store (Venafi) and apply the certificate to
                                a route. We created an automated renewal process and automated keystore's as well.

                                I worked on the development tools team where I began to onboard new tools into Delta's
                                environment. Delta was using clearcase with home-grown CI/CD tools:
                                RET, RET DEPOT and RET Deploy. We began conversations with different vendors to onboard the new
                                tools and we decided on Gitlab for our code repository, Nexus for the binary store, Jenkins for
                                the CI/CD system, Sonarqube for static code analysis and Slack for chatops. I worked on the
                                logical, physical and conceptual diagrams for each new tool and presented them to Delta's
                                architecture review board. After the tools were stood up, I worked on training the development
                                community on the new tools, how to use them and the best practices.

                                I worked on an application team in Home Depot's merchandising department.
                                I worked on an application called Supplier Onboarding. This application allowed
                                Home Depot merchant to onboard new vendors and new products. The Home Depot
                                merchant would create a contract with a vendor (Black and Decker, etc.) and the
                                contract would be signed, processed, and stored using the Supplier Onboarding
                                application. The technologies were HTML, AngularJS and CSS for the presentation layer,
                                JAVA for the RESTful service layer and DB2 for the database. I worked on developing
                                a single view for merchants so that the merchant could easily access existing contracts
                                and compare contracts. The feature saved merchants time and energy comparing existing
                                contracts to new contracts. Also, I worked on writing end to end tests using Protractor so
                                that when we did future development, we would know which test cases were broken before shipping
                                the application to production. Home Depot adopted a new CI system during this time
                                as well: Concourse CI. I worked to develop an end to end CI/CD pipeline for this application. That is,
                                build, package, test, scan, and deploy the application. The pipeline was triggered on every git commit
                                and it gave the team quick visibility into the health of the application.

                                I worked on a project called Data Source Simplification (DSS) or Tomcat Grid
                                Identity Management project. The DSS project created a workflow for data sources
                                to be automatically created without human intervention. This project spanned multiple
                                areas of Home Depot: security, architecture, database management, etc. Customers
                                would go through the One Click Deploy Eclipse Plug-in to deploy their application
                                to Home Depot's Grid. I created a new page in the workflow where the customer would be able to
                                choose their database (DB2, Cassandra, etc.) and request a data source for their application.
                                The customer (developer) would then click "Deploy" and the request for a data source would be triggered
                                to a RESTful interface, approvals would be triggered (if needed), etc. The customer could
                                check on the status of the Data Source as it went through the workflow process. For the fully
                                automated workflow, the application would be deployed and the data source would be
                                attached to the application immediately. For production data, the manager and database engineer
                                would receive an approval link in their email to approve/deny the data source. I used a
                                variety of tools and technologies in this project.

                                I worked on onboarding new development tools to the Home Depot environment. GitHub Enterprise
                                for Home Depot's code repository and JFrog Artifactory for Home Depot's binary store.
                                I worked along side my management to architect and build the systems.

                                I worked on the Application Platform and Development Tools team. I was primarily responsible for
                                Home Depot's Eclipse and Eclipse Plug-in development. Home Depot has an internal hosting
                                platform called the Grid. I worked on an Eclipse Plug-in called One Click Deploy which allowed
                                Developers to Deploy their applications to the Grid.
                                One Click Deploy interacted with a number of different systems: subversion, IBM MQ, Opsware, ServiceNow etc.
                                The technologies we used were Java with the Eclipse Plugin Development Platform. The developers
                                were able to right click their project, go to one click deploy, choose the development lifecycle:
                                DEV, QA, PRD and deploy their application. One Click Deploy allowed multiple different types of deployments
                                depending on the application requirements: Store, Bastion, etc.

                                Home Depot has an internal application platform called the Grid. The Grid primarily serves Java applications using
                                Tomcat. Every day there was a report on the status of the applications on the Grid and the report went out as a PDF
                                to the leadership team. I made a RESTful service layer (JAVA, JAX-RS, etc.) which connected to a Cassandra
                                Database (already present) and a Presentation Layer (HTML5, CSS, Javascript, Ajax, etc.) to display the Grid
                                in real time. We called the application GridStats and I was able to demo the application to my Vice President
                                at the end of my internship.
